# Go-Fish
Go-Fish Game in Java. User vs Computer. Version 1 of Development with intention to add GUI later.

RULES:
The User and the Opponent(Computer) both start with 7 cards. 
The user asks for a Card by entering the value as a number. 
Ace is 1 and Jack, Queen, King are 11,12,13 respectively.
If the card you've asked for is contained in the deck of
the oppent then you get all of their cards with that value.
If guessed incorrectly the player must draw from the Table Deck.(GO FISH!)
If the card drawn from the Table Deck is the one the player just
requested then the player goes again. The game ends if either
the Table Deck, User Hand, or Computer Hand are empty. 
The player with the most Books, which are 4 cards of the 
same value, at the end wins the game.
